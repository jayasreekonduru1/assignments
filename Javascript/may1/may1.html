    <h5 id="sub-heading">Google employee says he was fired just for watching coworkers protest against company's Israel contract</h5>
    <p>Last month, Google fired 28 employees after they protested the company's cloud computing contract, Project Nimbus, with Israel. The employees had staged sit-in protests at Google offices in California and New York. Some of these workers occupied Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian's office and were arrested over the same. However, as per recent report, looks like Google didn't just fire the protestors but also some of the people who were merely watching the protests. A former Google employee, who remains anonymous, told The Verge that he was fired just for witnessing the protest and talking to the protestors for barely "four minutes."</p>

    <p>The protests escalated when a group of employees occupied the office of <a href="">Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian for more than eight hours on Tuesday.</a> They broadcasted their sit-in live, declaring their demands during a Twitch livestream. These demands included Google severing all ties with the Israeli military and government, and addressing what they called a "health and safety crisis" amongst workers. As night fell, a company official approached the protesters, informing them they had been placed on administrative leave and requested they vacate the premises.</p>
